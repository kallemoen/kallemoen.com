I started my career as a magician but moved on to other interests. If you define the "magician" as someone who's in pursuit of power through knowledge, I still consider myself a magician. But instead of simple tricks, I now pursue wisdom and virtue more broadly. 

The last decade I've travelled full-time across the world and my work as been centered around entrepreneurship, product, and design. More recently I've setteled in Lisbon and did product work at <a href="https://www.immunefi.com/">Immunefi</a>, and now I am a partner at <a href="https://www.offchain.city/">Offchain</a>, a web3 and real-estate fund.
